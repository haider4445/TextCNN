## How to Run Code

```pip uninstall tensorflow
pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.14
python train.py
```

## For Different Dataset:
change the file name in the train.py and make possible changes in data_helpers.py


**[This code belongs to the "Implementing a CNN for Text Classification in Tensorflow" blog post.](http://www.wildml.com/2015/12/implementing-a-cnn-for-text-classification-in-tensorflow/)**

It is slightly simplified implementation of Kim's [Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882) paper in Tensorflow.

## Evaluating

```bash
./eval.py --eval_train --checkpoint_dir="./runs/1459637919/checkpoints/"
```

Replace the checkpoint dir with the output from the training. To use your own data, change the `eval.py` script to load your data.
